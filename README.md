# Improvisation of Netplumber Implementation

### Implementation of Netplumber with Ryu and OpenFlow 1.3

A new additional way to determine editing the rules by providing reliable statistical data. With the data, the higher value of the rule indicates that it would have more impacts to the entire network. Basically, it means that this rule is good or harmful. We are using Girvan-Newman Algorithm to implement this new feature.

Still **in progress**
